      <div class="main3-text">
        BLOOD DONATION MANAGEMENTSYSTEM is a software application to maintain day to day transactions in a blood bank. This software help to register all the donors, Blood collection details, blood issued details etc. It has a big plan to collect the blood from many different sources and distribute the same for the needy. A blood donation management system is a cache or bank of blood or blood components, gathered as a result of blood donation, stored and preserved for later use in blood transfusion. The term “Blood donation” typically refers to a division of a hospital laboratory where the storage of blood product occurs and where proper testing is performed to reduce the risk of transfusion related events. This includes compatibility testing for transfusion and may include blood donation processing, depending on the capabilities of the facility. The main objective of this application is to automate the complete operations of the blood bank. They need maintain hundreds of thousands of    records. Also searching should be very faster so they can find required details instantly. This application is built such a way that it should suits for all type of blood banks in future. So every effort is taken to implement this project in this blood bank, on successful implementation in this blood bank, we can target other blood banks in the city

      <div class="main3-text">
        The Book Store Management System  provides real time information about the books available in the Library and the user information. The main purpose of this project is to reduce the manual work. The project is specifically designed for the use of ADMINISTRATORs and library users. The product will work as a complete user interface for library management process and library usage from ordinary users. In the proposed system, we assume that each student will be having a student id which can be used for the library book issue, fine payment etc. whenever library student wish to take a book, the book issued by the library authority will be check both the book details as well as the user details and store it in library database. The administrator can control students and manage books. The student’s status of issue/return is maintained in the library database. The student’s details can be fetched by the Admin from the database as and when required. The valid students are also allowed to view their account information

        College E-Lecturer annotation System presents  an  entirely  new  learning  environment  for  students,  thus  requiring  a different  skill  set  to  be  successful .  Critical thinking, research, and evaluation skills are growing in importance as students have increasing volumes of information. College E-Lecturer annotation System can be viewed as computer assisted learning, and as pedagogy for student-centered and collaborative learning.  Early developments in e-learning focused on computer assisted learning, where part or all of the learning content is delivered digitally. It can be defined as 'learning facilitated and supported through the use of information and communications technology'. It can cover a spectrum of activities from the use of technology to support learning as part of a ‘blended’ approach (a combination of traditional and e-learning approaches), to learning that is delivered entirely online. Whatever the technology, however, learning is the vital element.
